                <section>
                    <p>I'm a designer who works with organizations interested in promoting their voices within the discussion of public affairs and social issues. I focus my efforts on projects that require careful management of specialized and multidisciplinary information, whose main challenge is a precise depiction of client's needs, desires and information into deliverables aimed at audiences that do not always have the same level of knowledge as my clients.</p>
                    <p>Among the services I offer are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>UI/UX Design</li>
                        <li>Web Design and Development</li>
                        <li>Graphic and Motion Design</li>
                        <li>Editorial and Promotional Design</li>
                        <li>Social and Digital Marketing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although I can operate completely remotely, I'm committed to work exclusively with clients from Canada and Mexico, countries that I call my home equally, where I have roots and wide knowledge of their people and their social environments, necessary requirements to work effectively for organizations that seek a long-term impact on the consciousness and practices of their publics and always aware that both countries have a rich cultural diversity.</p>
                    <p>It's a priority for me to be close to the people to whom my work is directed and, if necessary, I'm willing to go to their area to personally know their environments and practices as well as possible.</p>
